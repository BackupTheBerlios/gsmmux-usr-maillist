Subject: [gsmMux-usr] Testing with SonyEricsson GC85 card
Message-ID: <f0e2b92405072805491d98db9@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi,

I have been trying to run the mux with a SonyEricsson GC85 card on a
laptop with Fedora Core 1, but sofar it does not work.

Actually when starting the daemon everything seems fine. According to
the syslog all devices are started and no errors can be found.

However when I try to communicate through the ports I fail. I have
tried with minicom and with pppd but all I get is:
"Failed to open 'device' Input/output error"

How have the mux been tested previously?
Do you have any suggestion on how I should communicate with the mux?

(I can communicate with the card using both minicom and pppd when the
mux is turned off.)

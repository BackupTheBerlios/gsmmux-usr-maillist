Subject: [gsmMux-usr] [PATCH 1/1] Changed compile tools to be optional if
	environment is already set. Removed warnings for char pointers.
Message-ID: <632f5f310910060220o7171b230w16994d3ec038d63a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am compiling for the arm environment, and these warnings/error
occured when cross-compiling.

Does anyone use a dbus frontend for this? Or is it just an application
sending raw AT commands to the daemon?

We need to implement these features along with others, so i wanted to
get a feeling of what has already been done, and where i need to start
hacking :)

Thanks,
Ryan
